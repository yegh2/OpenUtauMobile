# OpenUtau Mobile Developer Preview

## Overview

To solve the performance issues, outdated UI design, and cross-platform limitations of the first-generation implementation, the project is being rebuilt from scratch.

The new version is based on:

* Avalonia 12.1
* .NET 10
* MVVM architecture

The goal is to provide a more modern, maintainable, and truly cross-platform mobile singing synthesis experience.

> [!WARNING]
> This branch is under heavy development.

> Architecture may change frequently.
